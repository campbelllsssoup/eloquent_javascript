// Exercise 9-2: Quoting Style : NOT DONE...

/*
    Imagine you have written a story and used single quotations marks
    throughout to mark pieces of dialogue. Now you want to replace all 
    the dialogue quotes with double quotes, while keeping the single
    quotes used in contractions like "aren't".

    Think of a pattern that distinguishes these two kinds of quote usage
    and craft a call to the replace method that does the proper replacement.
